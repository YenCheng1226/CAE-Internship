## Development of Deep Learning Algorithms for Raindrop Laser Disdrometer
### Introduction
Parsivel² (raindrop laser disdrometer) collects drop size distribution  (DSD) data, providing near-surface rainfall intensity, raindrop size, and fall velocity, and more. High-temporal-resolution rainfall intensity is estimated through internal algorithms. However, external factors such as winds can lead to biases.
Therefore, this study focuses on:
  - Compare observations of Sensors, Parsivel² and Pluvio² L to explore deviations in rainfall measurements
  - Apply machine learning algorithm to develop a Quality Control (QC) model for Parsivel² Data
